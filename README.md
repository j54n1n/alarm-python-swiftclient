Python bindings to the OpenStack Object Storage API
===================================================

This is a python client for the Swift API. There's a Python API (the
`swiftclient` module), and a command-line script (`swift`).

You can find the [documentation online](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined
in the [OpenStack wiki](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html).
The master repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient).

This code is based on original the client previously included with
[OpenStack's swift](https://github.com/openstack/swift). The python-swiftclient is licensed under the
Apache License like the rest of OpenStack.
